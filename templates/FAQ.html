            <div id="process-faq" class="faq-content">
                <div class="faq-question reveal">How long does the design process take?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The typical timeline for our design process is:</p>
                    <p>- Initial design concepts: 5-7 days after completing your design brief</p>
                    <p>- Revisions: 2-4 days per revision round</p>
                    <p>- Final design package: 2-3 days after approval of the final design</p>
                    <p>Most projects are completed within 2-3 weeks, though this can vary based on the complexity of the project and the number of revision rounds needed.</p>

                <div class="faq-question reveal">What information do I need to provide?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>To get started, you'll need to provide:</p>
                    <p>- Photos of your space</p>
                    <p>- Measurements of your room</p>
                    <p>- Your style preferences (our style quiz helps with this)</p>
                    <p>- Budget information</p>
                    <p>- Any existing pieces you want to keep</p>
                    <p>- Specific requirements or challenges</p>
                    <p>The more information you provide, the better your designer can understand your needs and create a design that's perfect for you.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-question reveal">Can I keep some of my existing furniture?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Absolutely! Many of our clients want to incorporate existing pieces into their new design. Simply let your designer know which items you want to keep, and they'll integrate them into your design.</p>
                    <p>It's helpful to provide photos and measurements of these pieces so your designer can accurately include them in your 3D renderings.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-question reveal">How many revisions can I request?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>All of our packages include unlimited revisions during the design process. We want to ensure you're completely satisfied with your final design.</p>
                    <p>Most clients go through 2-3 rounds of revisions before approving their final design, but you can request as many changes as needed until you're happy with the result.</p>
