            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer show">
                <p>Decorilla is an online interior design service that connects you with professional interior designers to create beautiful and functional spaces. You start by filling out a simple questionnaire about your style and needs, then designers create proposals for you to choose from. Once you select a designer, they work with you remotely to develop a design concept, create 3D renderings, and provide a shopping list. You can then purchase items at exclusive discounts.</p>
